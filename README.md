# aratea data

This repo contains (xml) data. Included are:
1) short documents on the Aratea texts, including brief introduction, list of editions (if available), secondary literature and existing manuscripts;
2) descriptions of medieval manuscripts of the Aratea texts;
3) transcriptions of the four manuscripts of the Aratus Latinus, as well as diplomatic transcriptions of smaller unedited treatises drawing on the Aratea;
4) OCR of older Aratea editions, which are already in the public domain;
5) Indices for works, persons, places and organisations mentioned in the MS descriptions.
The results of this on-going project are also available at: https://aratea-digital.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/.
